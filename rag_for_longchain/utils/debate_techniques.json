  "举例论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Example-Based Argumentation",
    "定义": "Example-based argumentation is a reasoning pattern that supports a general conclusion through concrete cases. It assumes that the properties shown by an individual or event are representative and can be generalized to similar situations. However, the validity of this reasoning depends on whether the case truly reflects the general situation. This method also allows examination of the limitations of the case, thereby challenging the opponent’s assumption of representativeness.",
    "场景背景": "In policy evaluation or ethical debates, advocates often use specific examples as evidence to support a claim, showing that a measure has positive effects under certain conditions; the opposing side may weaken the legitimacy of generalization by revealing that the case does not apply in other contexts.",
    "示例文本": "While the city-level data you cited does demonstrate the policy’s effectiveness in that region, it fails to cover rural areas and therefore cannot prove the policy applies nationwide.",
    "分析过程": "This technique begins with inductive reasoning, presuming that the properties in a specific case are universal; it then scrutinizes the case’s limitations to show that the underlying representativeness assumption of the induction may not hold, thereby weakening the logical rigor of the opponent’s argument structure.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Example-Based Argumentation\nLogical basis: Expose the failure of case representativeness to undermine the legitimacy of a generalized conclusion."
  },
  "价值论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Value-Based Argumentation",
    "定义": "Value-based argumentation relies on identifying core ethical or moral values to argue whether a behavior, policy, or viewpoint aligns with a particular value system. Its logical core is to establish the evaluative standard and assess the legitimacy or rationality of the behavior accordingly.",
    "场景背景": "In debates involving conflicts among plural values, each side typically argues from different moral standards or value orientations. By weighing the priorities and internal logic among values, one can construct the foundation of the argument.",
    "示例文本": "Although economic development is crucial, environmental protection—being the foundation of sustainability—should take priority to ensure long-term societal well-being.",
    "分析过程": "This method first clarifies the core value standard, then, through logical reasoning, articulates the internal relationships among different values, and on that basis argues that a behavior conforms to or violates the standard, thereby establishing its legitimacy.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Value-Based Argumentation\nLogical basis: Build a chain of justification grounded in a core value system to argue legitimacy and rationality."
  },
  "专家意见论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Appeal to Expert Opinion",
    "定义": "Appeal to expert opinion emphasizes the use of authoritative statements, domain expertise, and expert views to justify the reasonableness of a premise or conclusion. During the process, by reframing key terms and concepts, otherwise neutral statements gain authoritative support.",
    "场景背景": "In academic or professional debates, disputes over specialized issues often require introducing expert viewpoints. Using authoritative evidence can increase credibility and strengthen the logical soundness of the argument.",
    "示例文本": "As noted by a renowned psychology expert, ‘anger’ as an emotional expression can, in some contexts, inspire a sense of social justice; therefore, it should not be dismissed as a purely negative emotion.",
    "分析过程": "This technique first introduces statements from experts or authoritative institutions, reconstructs the semantic connotations of key terms to enhance evidential credibility, and then builds a logical inference chain based on expert opinion to justify the current view.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Appeal to Expert Opinion\nLogical basis: Leverage authoritative expert statements to reinforce the logical chain and persuasiveness of the argument."
  },
  "正面后果论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Positive Consequence Argumentation",
    "定义": "Positive consequence argumentation justifies a behavior or decision by presenting its beneficial outcomes and linking expected positive effects to the claim through logical reasoning, thereby making the argument more intuitive and persuasive.",
    "场景背景": "In debates on legal reform or policy evaluation, advocates often contrast historical developments with current outcomes to highlight positive changes brought about by modern systems or measures.",
    "示例文本": "A modern legal system—developed through multi-party collaboration—has not only ensured effective checks on power but also significantly advanced social fairness and justice.",
    "分析过程": "This method employs historical comparison and empirical data to logically derive the positive effects of institutional reform and uses this as the basis of argumentation; it establishes a chain of positive consequences to demonstrate the reasonableness and progressiveness of the viewpoint.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Positive Consequence Argumentation\nLogical basis: Demonstrate reform effects through a forward causal chain to justify the current measure."
  },
  "因果论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Causal Argumentation",
    "定义": "Causal argumentation establishes a clear cause–effect relationship—namely, that a given premise necessarily or highly likely leads to a specific outcome—to support the rationality of the claim. Its core lies in verifying the coherence and plausibility of the causal chain.",
    "场景背景": "In debates on technology, policy, or ethics, disputes often involve articulating causal relationships, such as the link between technological advancement and social effects; the advocate needs to demonstrate the necessary connection between premise and conclusion.",
    "示例文本": "If technological progress is not effectively regulated, it will inevitably lead to ethical risks such as privacy breaches, thereby negatively impacting society.",
    "分析过程": "The debater constructs and examines a causal chain to validate the necessary connection between premise and conclusion, while critically analyzing hidden premises to challenge the plausibility of the opponent’s causal chain.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Causal Argumentation\nLogical basis: Establish a cause–effect link between premise and outcome through logical reasoning to validate argumentative rigor."
  },
  "备选论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Alternative-Options Argumentation",
    "定义": "Alternative-options argumentation presents multiple feasible plans and, through comparative analysis, demonstrates that one plan is superior in overall soundness and rationality. The logical foundation lies in multi-dimensional trade-offs among options to build a strong decision-making argument.",
    "场景背景": "In public policy or resource-allocation debates, advocates often need to weigh the pros and cons of different plans to argue for the superiority of their proposal.",
    "示例文本": "Comparing fossil fuels with alternatives such as wind and solar energy, the latter show clear advantages in long-term economic returns and environmental impact.",
    "分析过程": "The debater conducts a comprehensive comparison of data, logic, and consequences across options to construct an argumentative support system, focusing on revealing each plan’s structural strengths and weaknesses to argue the proposed alternative’s rationality.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Alternative-Options Argumentation\nLogical basis: Demonstrate, via multi-option comparison, that the proposed plan achieves the best overall rationality."
  },
  "负面后果论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Negative Consequence Argumentation (Reductio-style)",
    "定义": "Negative consequence argumentation derives severe adverse effects that may result from the opponent’s view to refute its feasibility. Its logical basis is to push the argument toward extremes, showing that accepting the opponent’s premise would lead to absurd or unacceptable outcomes.",
    "场景背景": "In debates about risk management or ethical decision-making, advocates use deductive reasoning to illustrate extreme consequences likely to follow from the opponent’s position.",
    "示例文本": "If we adopt the view that ‘the harder the better,’ even high-risk ‘jumping off a building’ challenges could be deemed reasonable—an outcome that clearly violates basic safety common sense.",
    "分析过程": "The debater first assumes the opponent’s claim is true, then extends the logic to an extreme negative result; by critically examining key nodes in this chain, the debater reveals internal contradictions and the position’s unacceptability.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Negative Consequence Argumentation\nLogical basis: Use extreme logical extension to expose unreasonable outcomes entailed by the opponent’s argument."
  },
  "类比论证": {
    "辩论方法": "Analogical Argumentation",
    "定义": "Analogical argumentation supports a claim by comparing two situations with similar logical structure and inferring consistency in key properties. Its logical foundation lies in identifying and validating commonalities across contexts.",
    "场景背景": "In public policy or social reform debates, advocates cite successful cases from other countries or domains to show that, under similar structures, their claim is reasonable.",
    "示例文本": "Just as Country X achieved significant development after implementing this policy, with suitable adjustments in our context the same policy can likewise promote social progress.",
    "分析过程": "The debater first identifies logical commonalities between two cases or contexts, then infers similar conclusions through analogical reasoning; the key is verifying the consistency of critical conditions in the analogy to ensure logical rigor.",
    "输出样例": "Debate technique: Analogical Argumentation\nLogical basis: Validate the claim’s generality and rationality through analogy across similar contexts."
